# week1-horiseon-refractoring

## description of work completed

This project focused on refractoring the .html and .css files for Horiseon's website.  By refractoring this code, future developers will be able to better understand the website structure and more effectively find ways to make improvements.  You can view the website [DEMO](demo/01-html-css-git-homework-demo.png) as well as the live site on [GITHUB](https://emblair96.github.io/week1-horiseon-refractoring/).  

### improvements to html

* Added semantic html elements

* Added alt text to images

* Added working links on <nav> bar to the <article> elements

### improvements to css

* Condensed classes & ids to group common elements and shorten css code

* Added descriptive comments

### what I learned from this assignment

* Importance of clean and descritptive code so future developers who review the files can quickly understand what the website aims to achieve.  Effective methods to achieve this that I learned in this assignment include: 

    * Put comments in code

    * Add multiple, descriptive commits to github

### credits

I would like to credit my Northwestern Bootcamp instructor, Lori Culberson, and the TAs for the course, Tony and Pat, for helping build the foundation of my software development skillset through this assignment, as well as Triology Education.
